| **OVA**                 | Leverage Power Virtualization Center (PowerVC), to capture an Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA) image of the AIX workload and transfer the OVA to Power Systems Virtual Server  | Fully functional PowerVC environment Sufficient space to capture an OVA image OVA created by PowerVC  Ideal for small environment and noncritical workloads Longer downtime for migration                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Use public Internet** | Transfer System Backup Using the Public Internet via mksysb backup from an on-premises system to a Power Systems Virtual Server Instance using the public network connection.     | Migrations the backup over the internet and requires the following AIX Virtual Server Instance with Public Internet interface Access from On Premise network to Public Internet AIX mksysb: command is used to generate the backup. Thebackup can then be migrated over the internet using the customer's preferred method (for instance sftp) |
| **COS**                 | Transfer System Backup Using Cloud Object Storage and restore it into a Power Systems Virtual Server Instance using a Linux Virtual Server Instance for staging.                  | You will need Aspera to be setup for large volume migration image and data). Secure the connection from cloud to on-premises environment AIX Virtual Server Instance Direct Link Connect to IBM Cloud Cloud Object Storage Service NFS Server for Linux/AIX mksysb for AIX                                                                     |

Switch over to cloud when data is transferred over to cloud.                                                                                 |

Consider the tool, license cost, software capabilities, and delivery capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
