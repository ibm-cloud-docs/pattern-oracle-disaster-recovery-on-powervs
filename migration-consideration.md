# Migration solution approach
{: #migration-approach}

When workloads are deployed on a new system, you must pay attention to its configuration and tuning to achieve the expected performance. Power Virtual Server uses different IBM Power Systems: E980 (9080-M9S), S922 (9009-22A), and S1022 (9105-22A). For more information, see [Hardware specifications](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-about-virtual-server#hardware-specifications).

For AIX, Power Virtual Server supports only AIX 7.1 or later. If you use an unsupported version, it is subject to outages during planned maintenance windows with no advanced notification given. Your current AIX level and POWER processor family can help determine which migration path to follow.

IBM i customers must use IBM i 7.1 or later. Clients running IBM i 6.1 must first upgrade the operating system (OS) to a current support level before you migrate to the Power Systems Virtual Server. IBM i 7.2 supports direct [upgrades from IBM i 6.1 or 7.1 (N-2)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_72/rzahc/fastpathrzahc.htm){: external}.

## Migration checklist
{: #migration-checklist}

Before you migrate to a newer IBM Power System, review the following checklist:

1.  Plan the system migration.
1.  Install the latest required software and apply the available fixes.
1.  Set the appropriate processor compatibility mode for logical partitions (LPARs) before and after migration.
1.  Plan the virtual processor (VP) and entitlement for each LPAR to best fit your operation and performance requirements.
1.  Follow the I/O consideration guide.
