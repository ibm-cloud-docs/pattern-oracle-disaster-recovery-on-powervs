**Power Virtual Server is a common solution**
component for both of the Oracle disaster recovery patterns.  This section provides the PowerVS solution
architecture that will be used for the Oracle disaster recovery patterns.

**PowerVS is a fully contained, co-located,**
standalone offering and has its own management control plane, network, and
direct attached storage.   It provides a
simple and easy interface for creating storage and network resources required
for an Oracle Database disaster recovery implementation.

**PowerVS easily integrates with IBM Public**
Cloud Services such as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to
securely authenticate users, control access to PowerVS resources with resource
groups, and allow access to specific resources, and IBM Cloud Object Storage
(COS) to store backups.
