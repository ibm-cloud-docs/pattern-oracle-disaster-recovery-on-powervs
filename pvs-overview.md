# Overview

{: \#overview}

The objective of this pattern is to provide a solution design for an Oracle Database deployment on IBM Power Virtual Server that meets disaster recovery requirements for enterprise workloads.

This pattern is intended to:

- Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard IBM Power Virtual Server deployment architecture reference following the [IBM Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro).
- Provide a prescriptive, end-2-end enterprise-class solution design, with diagrams, component architecture decisions along with rationale for cloud component selection to meet enterprise requirements.
- Ensure requirements can be met from a performance, system availability and security perspective.

This pattern focuses on infrastructure deployment patterns.

The main objective of this document is to highlight and illustrate options for Oracle Database implementation on IBM Power Virtual Server for Disaster Recovery.

- Simplify the process of deploying Oracle Database on IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers.
- Ensure high performance, maximizing system availability, and a secure environment.
- Provide a prescriptive solution with full component choice(s) and rationale for component(s) selection.
- Illustrate reference implementation of Oracle Data Guard on Power Virtual Server environment across IBM regions.

  This document is not an implementation document, but a pattern which provides guidance for Power VS architecture to be deployed across Power Virtual server environment(s) and on premises Oracle DR requirement(s).
