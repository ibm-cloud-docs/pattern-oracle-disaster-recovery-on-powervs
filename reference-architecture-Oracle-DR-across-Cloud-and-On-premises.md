# Reference Architecture 2: Oracle Database Disaster Recovery between Customer DC and IBM PowerVS

## Architecture diagram

This reference architecture covers solution overview and details on how to design a Oracle Disaster recovery architectrue on IBM Power Virtual Server environment and customers existing Data center.

We assume that the primary workload is hosted on IBM Power Systems Virtual Server workspace and the Disaster recovery is hosted in a customer or 3rd Party Data center, however the workloads can also be reversed where the secondary workload is in IBM PowerVS and the Primary workload is in the customer Data center.

**Architecture overview**

The below figure shows high level deployment architecture with Oracle Data Guard and without Oracle Data Guard. It considers IBM PowerVS hosting as the primary site and the customer Data Center as the secondary site (DR). IBM VPC hosts common shared services such as IAM, DNS, Monitoring, management tools, and x86 workloads.

-   Primary environment is IBM Frankfurt region and Secondary environment is customer’s existing Data Center.
-   Configure network connectivity which will be accomplished through Direct Links to primary region with VPN access for Managed Service Provider(s) (MSPs).
-   An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security functions. For security purposes, all ingress and egress traffic will route through the Edge VPC. It contains an SFTP server, Bastion host (jump), Firewalls providing advanced security functions.
-   The Edge VPC is connected to the PowerVS environment through a local Transit Gateway. The PowerVS environment hosts the Oracle DB, the rest of the customer environment is hosted in VPC.
-   Public connectivity routes through Cloud Internet services which can provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to the edge VPC
-   The VPC connections to the PowerVS environment via a TGW and GRE tunnel.
-   Virtual Private endpoints are used to provide connectivity to cloud native services from each VPC.
-   Ensure the connectivity from customer environment is established to IBM PowerVS and security aspects are considered. To address the networking requirements, ensure to follow steps at following [link](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-network-architecture-diagrams).
-   Oracle DB are installed in LPARS with multiple Tier 1 LUNs for OS and DB that are used for boot and Database executable and to store DB schema.

**Oracle Disaster Recovery using Oracle Data Guard**

The Oracle Disaster recovery solution approach across IBM PowerVS and customer Data center are described below. This approach uses Oracle Data Guard to achieve Disaster recovery of Oracle DB across IBM Power Virtual Server and the customer Data Center.

The reference architect to host Oracle Database and x86 workloads on IBM cloud, includes key components required for oracle deployment on the Power Virtual Server environment.

**Environment deployed as a part of this reference architecture**

The primary environment workloads hosted in IBM include:

-   VPC environment
    -   Edge VPC cluster: hosts security components, firewall, and other edge services which are essentials for your environment.
    -   Management VPC cluster: hosts all the management tool stack needed to manage VPC and Power VS environments.
    -   Workload VPC cluster: hosts IBM VPC Virtual Server Instance (VSI) workloads. (x86 workloads).
    -   Transit gateway: connects VPC and Power Virtual workspace.
    -   Direct Link: connectivity to IBM cloud from customer’s existing Data center and other regional offices.
    -   VPN connection: for managed services to provide cloud managed operations.
    -   Load Balancer: if the customer external load balancing.
    -   Cloud internet Service: if DDoS and global load balancing is required.
    -   Virtual Private end points: are used to provide connectivity to cloud native services from each VPC. Monitoring tools: Activity tracker, Log DNA, and customer’s custom tools.
    -   Backup Environment via IBM Storage Protect or Veeam.
-   Power VS Environment
    -   Workload power VS cluster: actual Oracle Database primary instance.
    -   Storage required for LPARS.
    -   Cloud Object Storage configured for backup.

        **Customer Data Center:** This is the disaster recovery site.

-   Ensure you have all hardware components configured to meet your Primary workload requirements running in the IBM Power Virtual Server environment.
-   Ensure compute, storage, networking, security requirements, and pre-requisites are addressed for Oracle to replicate across both the sites.

    *Note: Carefully consider options for synchronous and asynchronous replication when designing database replication to meet the client requirements. It is recommended that you discuss latency between environments before you decide on a replication method for Oracle.*

**Software components used for the Oracle Data Guard deployment**

Table showing the components used for Oracle replication

| Software Component        | Target system component | Description                                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| DB replication Data Guard | Installed on LPAR       | Used for Oracle DB replication across another site. |

Note:

Active Data Guard allows you to read while the data is syncing. There is no need to pause they sync process

**Deployment Architecture Guidance**

Ensure you have completed the pre-requisites for IBM Power Virtual Server environment connectivity. Follow the necessary steps for a secured connection needed for a Power Virtual server environment. The Customer Data center connection to IBM Power virtual servers details are described here [cloud docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-network-architecture-diagrams).

As mentioned earlier, the [Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro) is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for which architecture decisions need to be made based on customer requirements. The following sections contain the considerations and architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are contained in the PowerVS common elements for both Oracle Resiliency solution patterns.
