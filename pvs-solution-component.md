# Solution Architecture - Power Virtual Server for Oracle Disaster Recovery

Power Virtual Server is a common solution component for both of the Oracle disaster recovery patterns. This section provides the PowerVS solution architecture that will be used for the Oracle disaster recovery patterns.

PowerVS is a fully contained, co-located, standalone offering and has its own management control plane, network, and direct attached storage. It provides a simple and easy interface for creating storage and network resources required for an Oracle Database disaster recovery implementation.

PowerVS easily integrates with IBM Public Cloud Services such as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to securely authenticate users, control access to PowerVS resources with resource groups, and allow access to specific resources, and IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) to store backups.

This section covers the IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers common solution components which are used in both reference architectures:

- Reference Architecture 1: Oracle Database Disaster Recovery on IBM PowerVS Cross Region
- Reference Architecture 2: Oracle Database Disaster Recovery between Customer DC and IBM PowerVS

  The common solution components listed in the table below are those components which are needed for both scenarios.

## Architecture framework

As mentioned earlier, the [Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro) is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for which architecture decisions need to be made based on customer requirements. The following sections contain the considerations and architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are contained in the PowerVS common elements for both Oracle Resiliency solution patterns.
